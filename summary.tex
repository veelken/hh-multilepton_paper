\section{Summary}
\label{sec:summary}

The results of a search for non-resonant as well as resonant $\HH$ production in final states with electrons, muons, and $\tauh$ has been presented.
The search is based on proton-proton collision data recorded by the CMS experiment at $\sqrt{s} = 13\TeV$ center-of-mass energy,
corresponding to an integrated luminosity of $137.2\fbinv$,
and targets the decay modes $\PW\PW\PW\PW$, $\PW\PW\PGt\PGt$, and $\PGt\PGt\PGt\PGt$.
Seven distinct final states, distinguished by the multiplicity of leptons and $\tauh$, are included in the analysis:
$0\Plepton + 4\tauh$, $1\Plepton + 3\tauh$, $2\Plepton\ss$, $2\Plepton + 2\tauh$, $3\Plepton$, $3\Plepton + 1\tauh$, and $4\Plepton$.
No evidence for a signal is found in the data and upper limits on the cross section for non-resonant as well as resonant $\HH$ production are set.
The observed (expected) limits on non-resonant $\HH$ production range from $XX$ to $XX$ ($XX$ to $XX$)~\pb, depending on the coupling scenario.
For the case of non-resonant $\HH$ production with event kinematics equal to the kinematics expected in the SM,
the observed (expected) upper limit on the cross section amounts to $XX$ ($XX$) times the rate expected in the SM.
The results of the search for non-resonant $\HH$ production are used to exclude regions in the plane of the $\PHiggs$ boson coupling to the top quark, $\yt$,
and of the trilinear $\PHiggs$ boson self-coupling, $\lambda$.
Assuming $\yt$ has the value expected in the SM, the trilinear $\PHiggs$ boson self-coupling is constrained to be within the interval $X.X < \lambda < X.X$.
For resonant $\HH$ production, the observed (expected) limits on the $\HH$ production cross section range from $XX$ to $XX$ ($XX$ to $XX$)~\pb, 
depending on the mass of the resonance and on its spin.
All limits are quoted at $95\%$ CL.
