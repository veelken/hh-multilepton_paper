\section{Results}
\label{sec:results}

The data selected in the seven search categories 
is tested against multiple $\HH$ production hypotheses,
described in Section~\ref{sec:introduction}: the SM prediction;
variations of the SM coupling strength modifiers
$\kappal$, $\kappat$, $\kappaV$, and $\kappaVV$;
the effective couplings $\cg$, $\cgg$, and $\ctwo$ in the EFT approach;
and resonant production from the decay of either spin-0 or
spin-2 particles with masses between $250$ and $1000\GeV$.
In each case, the entire dataset is fit simultaneously to a model
composed of the background prediction (with uncertainties),
and the $\HH$ signal hypothesis under consideration.

The SM ``signal strength'' parameter is defined as
$\mu = \sigma(\HH)_{\textrm{best fit}} / \sigma(\HH)_{\textrm{SM}}$,
and modifies the expected signal yield by the same proportion in each category.
By contrast, variations in the $\kappa$ modifiers may affect the signal yields in each
category differently and also change the BDT discriminant output shape for $\HH$ events.
The twelve benchmark scenarios spanning combinations of $\kappal$, $\kappat$,
$\cg$, $\cgg$, and $\ctwo$ values in the EFT phase space each correspond to
different signal kinematics, so the $\HH$ production cross section $\sigma$
for each point is measured separately.
Similarly, signal efficiency and BDT discriminant output shape vary dramatically for different
resonant masses, and thus, a separate measurement is performed for each mass and spin hypothesis.
The SM signal strength and $\kappa$ measurements are performed with $\ggHH$ and
$\qqHH$ signal MC simulation generated at NLO, using the SM ``node'' of the BDT
training in each event category to produce the final discriminator output distribution.
Each EFT point and resonant hypothesis has its own dedicated BDT node, and
is measured using a unique BDT output distribution in LO $\ggHH$ MC simulation.
[TODO: describe choice of BDT binning.]

The SM signal strength is measured using a profile likelihood test
statistic~\cite{Cowan:2010js}, with systematic uncertainties treated as nuisance
parameters $\theta$ in a modified frequentist approach~\cite{ATL-PHYS-PUB-2011-011}.
The likelihood ratio $q_{\mu}$ for a fixed ``test'' signal strength value $\mu$ is:
\begin{linenomath}
\begin{equation*}
  \begin{aligned}
    q_{\mu}  &  = -2 \Delta \ln \mathcal{L} = \ln \frac{\mathcal{L}(\mathrm{data}|\mu,\hat{\theta}_{\mu})}{\mathcal{L}(\mathrm{data}|\hat{\mu},\hat{\theta})}
  \end{aligned}
\end{equation*}
\end{linenomath}
where $\hat{\mu}$ and $\hat{\theta}$ are the signal strength and nuisance
parameter values which give the maximum value of likelihood $\mathcal{L}$
for the given set of data, and $\hat{\theta}_{\mu}$ is the set of nuisance
parameter values which maximize $\mathcal{L}$ for the fixed $\mu$ value.
The 95\% confidence interval includes all values of $\mu$ for which $q_{\mu} < 1.96$,
within approximately two standard deviations of the global best-fit value ($q_{\hat{\mu}} = 0$).
The SM coupling strength modifiers and the cross sections for the various $\HH$ production hypotheses
are measured by profiling values of $\kappa$ and $\sigma$, respectively,
relative to $\hat{\kappa}$ and $\hat{\sigma}$.
Theoretical and experimental uncertainties affecting the signal and
background yields or the shape of the BDT discriminant output distributions are fully
correlated across all years, event categories, and discriminant bins,
except as noted in Section~\ref{sec:systematicUncertainties}.

The fits to all BDT output ``node'' distributions in data are consistent with the
SM background prediction in all selection categories, within systematic uncertainties.
The observed 95\% confidence-level (CL) upper limit on the SM $\HH$ production cross section
amounts to $X.XX$~\pb ($Y.YY$ times the SM prediction), compared to an
expected limit of $Z.ZZ$~\pb in the absence of $\HH$ signal events.
These limits are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:HH_limits_SM} [TODO: Create],
for individual categories as well as for the combined result.
The \lttt and \lllnot categories provide the strongest individual
constraints on the SM $\HH$ cross section.

The 95\% CL interval for the Higgs boson trilinear self-coupling strength modifier
is measured to be $X.XX < \kappal < Y.YY$, where the upper limit is the [second]
strongest constraint on this fundamental SM parameter to date~\cite{Sirunyan:2745738,Sirunyan:2018ayu,2020135103}.

The observed and expected upper limits on the $\HH$ production cross section as a function of
$\kappal$ are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:HH_limits_kLambda}, along with limits for each event category.

The observed and expected limits on the $\HH$ production cross section in the
twelve EFT benchmark scenarios are shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:HH_limits_EFT}
and summarized in Table~TODO.
For benchmarks X, Y, and Z, the upper limit cross sections are lower
than for any previous measurement~\cite{Sirunyan:2745738}.
These benchmarks represent models in which the $\HH$ invariant mass is
lower than the SM prediction.  This analysis has a higher signal efficiency
in the low-mass phase space compared to $\HH$ analyses performed in final states with bottom quarks,
because the reconstruction and identification efficiency for low-$\pt$ electrons and muons is higher than for jets of low $\pt$ in CMS.

Figures~\ref{fig:HH_limits_spin0} and \ref{fig:HH_limits_spin2} show the observed and
expected limits on the resonant $\HH$ production cross section as a function of
$\HH$ invariant mass, for spin-0 and spin-2 particles decaying to a $\PHiggs$ boson pair.
Compared to previously published searches for resonant $\HH$
production~\cite{Sirunyan:2018ayu,2020135103},
this analysis has similar sensitivity at very low masses ($250$-$400\GeV$),
owing again to the efficient reconstruction and identification of low-$\pt$ leptons in CMS.
