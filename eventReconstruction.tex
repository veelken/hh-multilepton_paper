\section{Event reconstruction}
\label{sec:eventReconstruction}

"The pseudorapidity η is determined ..."; "The transverse momentum \pt with respect to the beam axis ...", and then henceforth use the symbol. Use the analogous procedure for the other variables: "The polar (azimuthal) angle ϑ (φ) with respect to the counterclockwise beam axis ..."





For each event, hadronic jets are clustered from these reconstructed particles using the infrared and collinear safe anti-\kt algorithm~\cite{Cacciari:2008gp, Cacciari:2011ma} with a distance parameter of 0.4. Jet momentum is determined as the vectorial sum of all particle momenta in the jet, and is found from simulation to be, on average, within 5 to 10\% of the true momentum over the whole \pt spectrum and detector acceptance. Additional proton-proton interactions within the same or nearby bunch crossings (pileup) can contribute additional tracks and calorimetric energy depositions to the jet momentum. To mitigate this effect, charged particles identified to be originating from pileup vertices are discarded and an offset correction is applied to correct for remaining contributions. Jet energy corrections are derived from simulation to bring the measured response of jets to that of particle level jets on average. In situ measurements of the momentum balance in dijet, $\text{photon} + \text{jet}$, $\PZ + \text{jet}$, and multijet events are used to account for any residual differences in the jet energy scale between data and simulation~\cite{Khachatryan:2016kdb}. The jet energy resolution amounts typically to 15--20\% at 30\GeV, 10\% at 100\GeV, and 5\% at 1\TeV~\cite{Khachatryan:2016kdb}. Additional selection criteria are applied to each jet to remove jets potentially dominated by anomalous contributions from various subdetector components or reconstruction failures. 

The missing transverse momentum vector \ptvecmiss is computed as the negative vector sum of the transverse momenta of all the PF candidates in an event, and its magnitude is denoted as \ptmiss~\cite{Sirunyan:2019kia}. The \ptvecmiss is modified to account for corrections to the energy scale of the reconstructed jets in the event.
